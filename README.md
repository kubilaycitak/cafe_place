# Finding the Most Suitable Place to Open Up a Cafe in Istanbul

Opening up a cafe in Istanbul might be difficult, but deciding to do so is even more difficult. You must have great strategies and come up with great ideas to successfully open up your cafe.

While doing so you can count endless challenges, and this project aimes to solve some of these challenges you may encounter.
